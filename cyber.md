# 1.Introduction to Cybercrime

## 1.1 what is cyber crime?
Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device. Most cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. However, occasionally cybercrime aims to damage computers or networks for reasons other than profit. These could be political or personal.

Cybercrime can be carried out by individuals or organizations. Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.

## 1.1.1  What is forgery?

Forgery refers to the act of creating, altering, or falsifying a document, signature, or other items with the intention to deceive or defraud others. It involves the imitation or reproduction of something valuable or significant, often with the aim of gaining an unfair advantage, financial gain, or causing harm to others.

## 1.1.2 Hacking

Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data. Hacking is not always a malicious activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.
##### Types of Hackers :
* 1.**Black Hat Hackers**
 : Black hat hacking refers to a evil practice. Black-hat Hackers are also known as an **Unethical Hacker or a Security Cracker**. These people hack the system illegally to steal money or to achieve their own illegal goals. They find banks or other companies with weak security and steal money or credit card information. They can also modify or destroy the data as well. Black hat hacking is illegal.

* 2.**White Hat Hackers**
 : White hat Hackers are also known as  **Ethical Hackers or a Penetration Tester**. White hat hackers are the good guys of the hacker world.

	These people use the same technique used by the black hat hackers. They also hack the system, but they can only hack the system that they have permission to hack in order to test the security of the system. They focus on security and protecting IT system. White hat hacking is legal.

 * 3.**Grey Hat Hackers**
 : Gray hat Hackers are Hybrid between Black hat Hackers and White hat hackers. They can hack any system even if they don't have permission to test the security of the system but they will never steal money or damage the system.

	In most cases, they tell the administrator of that system. But they are also illegal because they test the security of the system that they do not have permission to test. Grey hat hacking is sometimes acted legally and sometimes not.

##  1.1.3 Software Piracy
Software piracy is the act of stealing software that is legally protected. This stealing includes copying, distributing, modifying or selling the software.

Copyright laws were originally put into place so that the people who develop software (programmers, writers, graphic artists, etc.) would get the proper credit and compensation for their work. When software piracy occurs, compensation is stolen from these copyright holders.
Computer piracy is illegal and constitutes a federal crime. The monetary penalties for those who break this law can reach up to $150,000 per instance of copyright violation.
Here are the few types of software piracy
####  i) Softlifting

Softlifting is when someone purchases one version of the software and downloads it onto multiple computers, even though the software license states it should only be downloaded once. This often occurs in business or school environments and is usually done to save money. Softlifting is the most common type of software piracy.

####  ii) Client-server overuse

Client-server overuse is when too many people on a network use one main copy of the program at the same time. This often happens when businesses are on a local area network and download the software for all employees to use. This becomes a type of software piracy if the license doesn’t entitle you to use it multiple times.

####  iii) Hard disk loading

Hard disk loading is a type of commercial software piracy in which someone buys a legal version of the software and then reproduces, copies or installs it onto computer hard disks. The person then sells the product. This often happens at PC resale shops and buyers aren’t always aware that the additional software they are buying is illegal.

####  iv) Counterfeiting

Counterfeiting occurs when software programs are illegally duplicated and sold with the appearance of authenticity. Counterfeit software is usually sold at a discounted price in comparison to the legitimate software.

####  v) Online Piracy

Online piracy, also known as Internet piracy, is when illegal software is sold, shared or acquired by means of the Internet. This is usually done through a peer-to-peer (P2P)  file-sharing system  which is usually found in the form of online auction sites and blogs.

## 1.1.4 Computer Network intrusion
A network intrusion refers to any unauthorized activity on a digital network. Network intrusions often involve stealing valuable network resources and always the security of networks and/or their data.

In order to proactively detect and respond to network intrusions organizations and their cybersecurity teams need to have a thorough understanding of how network intrusions work and implement network intrusion, detection, and response systems that are designed with attack techniques and cover-up methods in mind.
#### IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a monitor-only program that detects and reports irregularities in your network architecture before hackers may do damage. IDS can be set up on your network or on a client system (host-based IDS).
#### Types of Intrusion
-   Asymmetric Routing
-   Buffer Overflow Attacks
-   Common Gateway Interface Scripts
-   Protocol-Specific Attacks
-   Traffic Flooding
-   Trojans
-   Worms

1.  **Host Intrusion Detection System:**  This system operates on network hosts or standalone devices. It takes a snapshot of the current system files and compares it to prior snapshots. Similarly, if the analytical system files are modified or destroyed, an alert is sent to the administrator for further inquiry.

2.  **Network Intrusion Detection System:**  They are strategically located across the network to monitor traffic from all devices connected to the Internet. Primarily, it performs an analysis of passing traffic on the whole subnet and compares that information to a database of known threats. When it detects an assault or detects strange activity, it alerts the administrator.

# 1.2 Category of Cyber Crime

## 1.2.1 How criminals plan attacks
1.  Reconnaissance (information gathering) is the first phase
2.  Scanning and scrutinizing the gathered information for the validity of the informationas as well as to identify the existing vulnerabilities.
3. gaining and maintaining the system access
4. Launching an attack

## 1.2.2 Active and Passive Attack :
In **Active attack**, attackers put effort to change or modify the content of messages or data or system. Active attack is dangerous to integrity as well as to availability.System is always changed or badly affected.
	Most importantly Victim gets informed about the attack.
	example : Dos attack,Sql injection,Cross site scripting,Malware,virus etc.

In **Passive attack** attackers try to get unauthorized access to the system to observe the content or data or the can copy the data to.But no direct Harm to the system.
		Victim does not get informed about the attack.
		example : Man in the middle, Social Engineering , shoulder surfing etc.

## 1.2.3 Cyberstalking

Cyberstalking is a technologically-based "attack" on one person who has been targeted specifically for that attack for reasons of anger, revenge or control. Cyberstalking can take many forms, including: harassment, embarrassment and humiliation of the victim.

# 2. Cybercrime Mobile & Wireless devices

## 2.1 Security challenges posted by mobile devices

**i). Application based threat:**
The most of application are downloadable and purposed the most common risk for mobile users; most devices don’t do much on their own, and it is the applications that make them so awesome and we all download apps. If it comes to apps the risks run from bugs and basic security risks on the low end of the scale all the way through malicious apps with no other purpose to commit cyber crime.

-   Malware
-   Spyware
-   Privacy
-   Zero Day Vulnerabilities

**ii). Web based threat:**
According to the nature of mobile use, the fact that we have our devices with us everywhere we go and are connecting to the Internet while doing so, they face the number of unique web-based threats as well as the run-of-the-mill threats of general Internet use.

-   Phishing Scams
-   Social Engineering
-   Drive By Downloads
-   Operating System Flaws

**iii). Network-based threat:**
Any mobile devices which typically support a minimum of three network capabilities making them three-times vulnerable to network-based attack. And a network often found on a mobile include cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth.-
-   Network exploits
-   WiFi sniffing
-   Cross-Platform Attacks
-   BOYD

**iv). Physical Threats:**
It is happened any time, unlikely a desktop sitting at your workstation, or even a laptop in your bag, a mobile device is subject to a number of everyday physical threats.

-   **Loss/Theft:**
    Loss or theft is the most unwanted physical threat to the security of your mobile device. Any devices itself has value and can be sold on the secondary market after all your information is stolen and sold.

## 2.2 Cryptographic Security for Mobile Devices

## 2.3 Various types of virus in laptop

-   **File Virus:**
    This type of virus infects the system by appending itself to the end of a file. It changes the start of a program so that the control jumps to its code. After the execution of its code, the control returns back to the main program. Its execution is not even noticed. It is also called a  **Parasitic virus** because it leaves no file intact but also leaves the host functional.

-   **Boot sector Virus:**
    It infects the boot sector of the system, executing every time system is booted and before the operating system is loaded. It infects other bootable media like floppy disks. These are also known as  **memory viruses** as they do not infect the file systems.


-   **Macro Virus:**
    Unlike most viruses which are written in a low-level language(like C or assembly language), these are written in a high-level language like Visual Basic. These viruses are triggered when a program capable of executing a macro is run. For example, the macro viruses can be contained in spreadsheet files.

-   **Source code Virus:**
    It looks for source code and modifies it to include virus and to help spread it.

-   **Polymorphic Virus:**
    A  **virus signature**  is a pattern that can identify a virus(a series of bytes that make up virus code). So in order to avoid detection by antivirus a polymorphic virus changes each time it is installed. The functionality of the virus remains the same but its signature is changed.

-   **Encrypted Virus:**
    In order to avoid detection by antivirus, this type of virus exists in encrypted form. It carries a decryption algorithm along with it. So the virus first decrypts and then executes.

-   **Stealth Virus:**
    It is a very tricky virus as it changes the code that can be used to detect it. Hence, the detection of viruses becomes very difficult. For example, it can change the read system call such that whenever the user asks to read a code modified by a virus, the original form of code is shown rather than infected code.

-   **Tunneling Virus:**
    This virus attempts to bypass detection by antivirus scanner by installing itself in the interrupt handler chain. Interception programs, which remain in the background of an operating system and catch viruses, become disabled during the course of a tunneling virus. Similar viruses install themselves in device drivers.

-   **Multipartite Virus:**
    This type of virus is able to infect multiple parts of a system including the boot sector, memory, and files. This makes it difficult to detect and contain.

-   **Armored Virus:**
    An armored virus is coded to make it difficult for antivirus to unravel and understand. It uses a variety of techniques to do so like fooling antivirus to believe that it lies somewhere else than its real location or using compression to complicate its code.

-   **Browser Hijacker:**
    As the name suggests this virus is coded to target the user’s browser and can alter the browser settings. It is also called the browser redirect virus because it redirects your browser to other malicious sites that can harm your computer system.
-   **Memory Resident Virus:**

	Resident viruses installation store for your RAM and meddle together along with your device operations. They behave in a very secret and dishonest way that they can even connect themselves for the anti-virus software program files.

-   **Direct Action Virus:**

	The main perspective of this virus is to replicate and take action when it is executed. When a particular condition is met the virus will get into action and infect files in the directory that are specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file path.

-   **Overwrite virus:**

	This type of virus deletes the information contained in the file that it infects, rendering them partially or totally is useless once they have been infected.

-   **Directory Virus:**

	This virus is also called called File System Virus or Cluster Virus. It infects the directory of the computer by modifying the path that is indicating the location of a file.

-   **Companion Virus:**

	This kind of virus usually use the similar file name and create a different extension of it. For example, if there’s a file “Hello.exe”, the virus will create another file named Hello.com  and will hide in the new file

-   **FAT Virus:**

	The  **File Allocation Table** is the part of the disk used to store all information about the location of files, available space , unusable space etc.

	This virus affects the FAT section and may damage crucial information.

# 3. Tools and Methods used in Cyber crime

## 3.1 proxy servers

The proxy server is a computer on the internet that accepts the incoming requests from the client and forwards those requests to the destination server. It works as a gateway between the end-user and the internet. It has its own IP address. It separates the client system and web server from the global network.

In other words, we can say that the proxy server allows us to access any websites with a different IP address. It plays an intermediary role between users and targeted websites or servers. It collects and provides information related to user requests. The most important point about a proxy server is that it does not encrypt traffic.

There are two main purposes of proxy server:

* To keep the system behind it anonymous.
* To speed up access to a resource through caching.

## 3.2 panword checking

didn't get anything about it

## 3.3  Random checking

In the context of cybersecurity, "random checking" refers to the practice of conducting random assessments or checks to evaluate the security of systems, networks, or processes. It involves selecting and examining elements or components in a non-systematic or unpredictable manner to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or compliance issues. Random checking can be employed in various areas of cybersecurity. Here are a few examples:

* **Vulnerability Assessments**: Random vulnerability scanning involves using automated tools to randomly scan systems or networks for potential security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. The scanning tools target random IP addresses or network segments to identify any known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

 * **Penetration Testing**: Randomized elements can be included in penetration testing engagements. Penetration testing involves simulating real-world attacks to assess the security posture of a system or network. Random checks and tests may be performed to mimic how an attacker might choose targets or exploit vulnerabilities, adding an element of unpredictability.

 * **Employee Awareness Training**: Random phishing simulations or social engineering tests can be conducted to assess employees' security awareness and their ability to detect and respond appropriately to potential threats. Randomly selected employees may be sent simulated phishing emails or subjected to social engineering attempts to evaluate their level of susceptibility.

* **Compliance Audits**: Random audits can be conducted to assess compliance with security policies, regulations, or industry standards. For example, random checks may be performed to verify if employees are adhering to password complexity requirements, data handling procedures, or access controls outlined in the organization's security policies.

* **Incident Response Exercises**: Random scenarios can be used in incident response drills or tabletop exercises to simulate cybersecurity incidents. Randomly selecting different attack vectors, system components, or scenarios helps test the effectiveness of incident response plans, communication channels, and incident handling processes.

Random checking provides a means to introduce unpredictability and test security measures in a less predictable manner. It helps organizations identify potential blind spots, weaknesses, or gaps in their security posture that may not be apparent through systematic or routine assessments.

## 3.4 Trojan Horses

**The original story of the Trojan horse** can be found in the Aeneid by Virgil and the Odyssey by Homer. In the story, the enemies of the city of Troy were able to get inside the city gates using a horse they pretended was a gift. The soldiers hid inside the huge wooden horse and once inside, they climbed out and let the other soldiers in.


A **Trojan Horse Virus** is a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software.

A simple way to answer the question "what is Trojan" is it is a type of malware that typically gets hidden as an attachment in an email or a free-to-download file, then transfers onto the user’s device. Once downloaded, the malicious code will execute the task the attacker designed it for, such as gain backdoor access to corporate systems, spy on users’ online activity, or steal sensitive data.

Indications of a Trojan being active on a device include unusual activity such as computer settings being changed unexpectedly.

## 3.5 Backdoors

In cybersecurity terms, a **Backdoor Attack** is an attempt to infiltrate a system or a network by maliciously taking advantage of software's weak point.

Backdoors allow the attackers to quietly get into the system by deceiving the security protocols and gain administrative access. It is similar to the real-life robbery in which burglars take advantage of the loopholes in a house and get a 'backdoor' entry for conducting the theft.

After gaining high-level administrative privilege, the cyber attackers could perform various horrendous tasks like injecting spyware, gaining remote access, hack the device, steal sensitive information, encrypt the system through ransomware, and many more.

Backdoors are originally meant for helping software developers and testers, so they are not always bad.

Types of Backdoor :
As mentioned, Backdoors are not always malicious. Here are the two types of Backdoors as per their intentions.

* **i) Administrative Backdoor**
Sometimes software developers intentionally leave a backdoor into the program so that in case of any failure or error, they can easily reach the core of the software's code and quickly solve the issue. Such Backdoors are called the Administrative Backdoors. These deliberate Backdoors can also help the software testers to testify the codes.

	Though such Backdoors are only known to the developers, a skillful hacker can take advantage of it and silently use it for his benefit. So Administrative Backdoor can be called a type of loophole in the program.

* **ii) Malicious Backdoor**
Malicious Backdoors are the backdoors installed on the system by cybercriminals using malware programs like Remote Access Trojan (RAT). These are specifically designed for taking control of the system or network and conduct malicious tasks. RAT is a malware program that can reach the root of the system and install the backdoor. RAT is generally spread through a malicious program.

## 3.6  DOS & DDOS attacks

### 3.6.1 **DOS attacks**

A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a tactic for overloading a machine or network to make it unavailable. Attackers achieve this by sending more traffic than the target can handle, causing it to fail—making it unable to provide service to its normal users. Examples of targets might include email, online banking, websites, or any other service relying on a targeted network or computer.

There are different types of DoS attacks such as resource exhaustion and flood attacks. Resource exhaustion attacks cause the targeted infrastructure to use all of its available memory or storage resources, slowing the service's performance or stopping it all together. Flood attacks send an overwhelming number of packets that exceed server capacity.

### 3.6.2 **DDOS attacks**

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) is a type of DoS attack where the traffic used to overwhelm the target is coming from many distributed sources. This method means the attack can't be stopped just by blocking the source of traffic.

Botnets are often employed for DDoS attacks.

## 3.7 SQL injection attack

* SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.

* SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.

* SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):

```javascript
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
```
## 3.8 Buffer Overflow Attack

Buffer overflow is a software coding error or vulnerability that can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to corporate systems. It is one of the best-known software security vulnerabilities yet remains fairly common. This is partly because buffer overflows can occur in various ways and the techniques used to prevent them are often error-prone.

The software error focuses on buffers, which are sequential sections of computing memory that hold data temporarily as it is transferred between locations. Also known as a buffer overrun, buffer overflow occurs when the amount of data in the buffer exceeds its storage capacity. That extra data overflows into adjacent memory locations and corrupts or overwrites the data in those locations.

### Consequence of Buffer Overflow :

* **System crashes :** A buffer overflow attack will typically lead to the system crashing. It may also result in a lack of availability and programs being put into an infinite loop.

* **Access control loss :** A buffer overflow attack will often involve the use of arbitrary code, which is often outside the scope of programs’ security policies.

* **Further security issues :** When a buffer overflow attack results in arbitrary code execution, the attacker may use it to exploit other vulnerabilities and subvert other security services.

### Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks

There are several types of buffer overflow attacks that attackers use to exploit organizations’ systems. The most common are:

* **Stack-based buffer overflows :** This is the most common form of buffer overflow attack. The stack-based approach occurs when an attacker sends data containing malicious code to an application, which stores the data in a stack buffer. This overwrites the data on the stack, including its return pointer, which hands control of transfers to the attacker.

* **Heap-based buffer overflows :** A heap-based attack is more difficult to carry out than the stack-based approach. It involves the attack flooding a program’s memory space beyond the memory it uses for current runtime operations.

* **Format string attack :** A format string exploit takes place when an application processes input data as a command or does not validate input data effectively. This enables the attacker to execute code, read data in the stack, or cause segmentation faults in the application. This could trigger new actions that threaten the security and stability of the system.

# 4.1 Phishing & Identity Theft

## 4.1.1 Phising

Phishing attacks are the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. It is usually done through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information, or to install malware on the victim’s machine. Phishing is a common type of cyber attack that everyone should learn about in order to protect themselves.

TYpes of Phising :

* **Email phishing** :
	Most phishing attacks are sent by email. The crook will register a fake domain that mimics a genuine organisation and sends thousands of generic requests.

	The fake domain often involves character substitution, like using ‘r’ and ‘n’ next to each other to create ‘rn’ instead of ‘m’.

	In other cases, the fraudsters create a unique domain that includes the legitimate organisation’s name in the URL. The example below is sent from ‘olivia@amazonsupport.com’.

	The recipient might see the word ‘Amazon’ in the sender’s address and assume that it was a genuine email.

	There are many ways to spot a phishing email, but as a general rule, you should always check the email address of a message that asks you to click a link or download an attachment.

* **Spear phishing** :
  There are two other, more sophisticated, types of phishing involving email.

	The first, spear phishing, describes malicious emails sent to a specific person. Criminals who do this will already have some or all of the following information about the victim:

	* Their name.
	* Place of employment.
	* Job title.
	* Email address; and
	* Specific information about their job role.
	The fraudster has the wherewithal to address the individual by name and (presumably) knows that their job role involves making bank transfers on behalf of the company.

	The informality of the email also suggests that the sender is a native English speaker and creates the sense that this is a real message rather than a template.

* **Whaling** :
	Whaling attacks are even more targeted, taking aim at senior executives. Although the end goal of whaling is the same as any other kind of phishing attack, the technique tends to be a lot subtler.

	Tricks such as fake links and malicious URLs aren’t helpful in this instance, as criminals are attempting to imitate senior staff.

	Whaling emails also commonly use the pretext of a busy CEO who wants an employee to do them a favour.

	If some hacker who prentends to be employee ask for something to authority easliy that busy senior will reply back and give that junior proper credentials to complete the task.

* **Smishing and vishing** :
	With both smishing and vishing, telephones replace emails as the method of communication.

	Smishing involves criminals sending text messages (the content of which is much the same as with email phishing), and vishing involves a telephone conversation.

* **Angler phishing** :
	A relatively new attack vector, social media offers several ways for criminals to trick people. Fake URLs; cloned websites, posts, and tweets; and instant messaging (which is essentially the same as smishing) can all be used to persuade people to divulge sensitive information or download malware.


## 4.1.2 ID/Identity Theft

Identity theft is the crime of obtaining the personal or financial information of another person to use their identity to commit fraud, such as making unauthorized transactions or purchases. Identity theft is committed in many different ways and its victims are typically left with damage to their credit, finances, and reputation.

Identity theft occurs when someone steals your personal information—such as your Social Security Number, bank account number, and credit card information. Identity theft can be committed in many different ways. Some identity thieves sift through trash bins looking for bank account and credit card statements.

More high-tech methods involve accessing corporate databases to steal lists of customer information. Once identity thieves have the information they are looking for, they can ruin a person's credit rating and the standing of other personal information.
1

Identity thieves increasingly use computer technology to obtain other people's personal information for identity fraud. To find such information, they may search the hard drives of stolen or discarded computers; hack into computers or computer networks; access computer-based public records; use information-gathering malware to infect computers; browse social networking sites; or use deceptive emails or text messages

Types :

* **Financial Identity Theft :**
  In financial identity theft, someone uses another person's identity or information to obtain credit, goods, services, or benefits. This is the most common form of identity theft.

* **Social Security Identity Theft:**
If identity thieves obtain your Social Security Number, they can use it to apply for credit cards and loans and then not pay outstanding balances. Fraudsters can also use your number to receive medical, disability, and other benefits.
* **Medical Identity Theft:**
In medical identity theft, someone poses as another person to obtain free medical care
* **Synthetic Identity Theft:**
Synthetic identity theft is a type of fraud in which a criminal combines real (usually stolen) and fake information to create a new identity, which is used to open fraudulent accounts and make fraudulent purchases. Synthetic identity theft allows the criminal to steal money from any credit card companies or lenders who extend credit based on the fake identity.
* **Child Identity Theft:**
In child identity theft, someone uses a child's identity for various forms of personal gain. This is common, as children typically do not have information associated with them that could pose obstacles for the perpetrator.

	The fraudster may use the child's name and Social Security Number to obtain a residence, find employment, obtain loans, or avoid arrest on outstanding warrants. Often, the victim is a family member, the child of a friend, or someone else close to the perpetrator. Some people even steal the personal information of deceased loved ones.
* **Tax Identity Theft:**
Tax identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information, including your Social Security Number, to file a bogus state or federal tax return in your name and collect a refund.
* **Criminal Identity Theft:**
In criminal identity theft, a criminal poses as another person during an arrest to try to avoid a summons, prevent the discovery of a warrant issued in their real name or avoid an arrest or conviction record

## 4.1.3 Online identity verification method

Identity verification has various methods and systems. This process may consist of different approaches.

these techniques commonly fall into one of the following six categories;

* Knowledge-based authentication
* Two-factor authentication
* Credit bureau-based authentication
* Database methods
* Online verification
* Biometric verification

* **i) Knowledge-based authentication:**
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) verifies a person’s identity by requiring a response to security questions. These questions are generally designed to be simple for that person to answer but difficult for anyone to answer. Like “How many pets do you have?” or “Who was your favorite teacher?
* **ii) Two-factor authentication:**
Two-factor or Multi-Factor Authentication requires your customer to enter a code sent to their email or mobile phone. Because the verification method is common, the process is very recognizable and simple for consumers to understand and apply. Using 2FA or MFA, you can easily verify a consumer’s email address and phone number. This can be important if you need to make sure your customer did not type in their data incorrectly.
* **iii) Credit bureau-based authentication:**
A credit bureau-based authentication method relies on data from one or more of the credit bureaus. These companies store a massive amount of credit information on consumers, including name, address, and social security number. Credit-based authentication uses a score to create a definite match without compromising the user’s experience. However, it may not match thin credit files, such as young people and recent immigrants.
* **iv) Database methods:**
Database ID methods use data from a variety of sources to verify someone’s identity card. Database methods are generally used to assess the level of risk a user poses because they significantly reduce the need for manual reviews. The most significant disadvantage of these methods is that they don’t ensure that the person providing the information is the person conducting the transaction, mostly due to the proliferation of false online identities.
* **v) Online verification:**
Online verification uses techniques to determine if a government-issued id relates to the users, including artificial intelligence, computer vision, and human review. This verification method typically requires users to give a picture of themselves holding an ID, thus ensuring the person on the ID is the same person holding the ID. Online verification is very secure, but some users find submitting an image of their face and ID inconvenient or intrusive.
* **vi) Biometric verification:**
Biometrics can be used to identify and authenticate people based on physical characteristics. Biometric techniques are; facial recognition, voice recognition, iris, and retina scanning and fingerprinting. These methods offer a high level of convenience to customers (after the initial setup has occurred) as no passwords need to be remembered, no questions need to be answered, etc.

	However, biometrics has some flaws. Biometrics can be stolen. Think about it, your pictures are all over social media. Your voice can be recorded unknowingly. Databases can be hacked to retrieve fingerprints. And once these types of assets are in the hands of a bad person, it can be even easier to defraud some institutions.


# 4.2 Cybercrime & Cybersecurity

## 4.2.1 Legal aspects

The legal aspects of cybersecurity encompass a wide range of laws, regulations, and practices that govern and address issues related to the use, protection, and misuse of digital information and technology. Here are some key legal aspects to consider in the realm of cybersecurity:

Data Protection and Privacy Laws: Many countries have enacted data protection and privacy laws that regulate how organizations handle and protect personal data. These laws typically outline requirements for obtaining consent, data breach notification, data transfer, and individual rights concerning their personal information.

* **Intellectual Property Laws :** Intellectual property laws protect various forms of creative works, such as copyrights, trademarks, and patents. In the context of cybersecurity, these laws can be relevant in cases of software piracy, unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted material, or theft of trade secrets.

*  **Computer Crime Laws :** Computer crime laws or cybercrime laws address criminal activities conducted through or against computer systems. These laws cover offenses such as hacking, unauthorized access, malware distribution, identity theft, phishing, and other malicious activities conducted online.

* **Cybersecurity Regulations :** Some industries, such as finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure, have specific cybersecurity regulations that impose requirements for protecting sensitive data and implementing security controls. Compliance with these regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is legally mandated.

* **International Law and Cybersecurity :** Cybersecurity has become a global concern, leading to international efforts to establish norms, guidelines, and agreements to address cyber threats. Examples include the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications, which discusses international cybersecurity norms, and the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, a treaty focusing on combating cybercrime and fostering international cooperation.

## 4.2.3 Public key certificate

A public key certificate is a digitally signed document that serves to validate the sender's authorization and name. It uses a cryptographic structure that binds a public key to an entity, such as a user or organization. The digital document is generated and issued by a trusted third party called a certification authority.

Public key certificates, which are also known as digital certificates, include the public key, identity information about the owner and the name of the issuing certificate authority (CA). The CA, a trusted third party, issues digital certificates that verify the identity of parties in an exchange of information over the internet. A digital certificate provides assurance of a person's identity, and the CA establishes that assurance by validating the identity of the person who requests the certificate.

### **How does a public key certificate work?**

=> Public key certificates form a part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) system that uses encryption technology to secure messages and data. A public key certificate uses a pair of encryption keys, one public and one private. The public key is made available to anyone who wants to verify the identity of the certificate holder, while the private key is a unique key that is kept secret. This enables the certificate holder to digitally sign documents, emails and other information without a third party being able to impersonate them. The four main components of PKI are public key encryption, trusted third parties such as the CA, the registration authority and the certificate database or store.
