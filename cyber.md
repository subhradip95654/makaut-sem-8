# 1.Introduction to Cybercrime

## 1.1 what is cyber crime?
Cybercrime is criminal activity that either targets or uses a computer, a computer network or a networked device. Most cybercrime is committed by cybercriminals or hackers who want to make money. However, occasionally cybercrime aims to damage computers or networks for reasons other than profit. These could be political or personal.

Cybercrime can be carried out by individuals or organizations. Some cybercriminals are organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled. Others are novice hackers.

## 1.1.1  What is forgery?
  
Forgery refers to the act of creating, altering, or falsifying a document, signature, or other items with the intention to deceive or defraud others. It involves the imitation or reproduction of something valuable or significant, often with the aim of gaining an unfair advantage, financial gain, or causing harm to others.

## 1.1.2 Hacking 

Hacking is the act of identifying and then exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network, usually to gain unauthorized access to personal or organizational data. Hacking is not always a malicious activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due to its association with cybercrime.
##### Types of Hackers : 
<b>1.Black Hat Hackers
 : Black hat hacking refers to a evil practice. Black-hat Hackers are also known as an **Unethical Hacker or a Security Cracker**. These people hack the system illegally to steal money or to achieve their own illegal goals. They find banks or other companies with weak security and steal money or credit card information. They can also modify or destroy the data as well. Black hat hacking is illegal.
 
 <b>2.White Hat Hackers
 : White hat Hackers are also known as  **Ethical Hackers or a Penetration Tester**. White hat hackers are the good guys of the hacker world.

	These people use the same technique used by the black hat hackers. They also hack the system, but they can only hack the system that they have permission to hack in order to test the security of the system. They focus on security and protecting IT system. White hat hacking is legal.
 
 <b>3.Grey Hat Hackers
 : Gray hat Hackers are Hybrid between Black hat Hackers and White hat hackers. They can hack any system even if they don't have permission to test the security of the system but they will never steal money or damage the system.
 
	In most cases, they tell the administrator of that system. But they are also illegal because they test the security of the system that they do not have permission to test. Grey hat hacking is sometimes acted legally and sometimes not.
	
##  1.1.3 Software Piracy
Software piracy is the act of stealing software that is legally protected. This stealing includes copying, distributing, modifying or selling the software.

Copyright laws were originally put into place so that the people who develop software (programmers, writers, graphic artists, etc.) would get the proper credit and compensation for their work. When software piracy occurs, compensation is stolen from these copyright holders.
Computer piracy is illegal and constitutes a federal crime. The monetary penalties for those who break this law can reach up to $150,000 per instance of copyright violation.
Here are the few types of software piracy 
####  i) Softlifting

Softlifting is when someone purchases one version of the software and downloads it onto multiple computers, even though the software license states it should only be downloaded once. This often occurs in business or school environments and is usually done to save money. Softlifting is the most common type of software piracy.

####  ii) Client-server overuse

Client-server overuse is when too many people on a network use one main copy of the program at the same time. This often happens when businesses are on a local area network and download the software for all employees to use. This becomes a type of software piracy if the license doesn’t entitle you to use it multiple times.

####  iii) Hard disk loading

Hard disk loading is a type of commercial software piracy in which someone buys a legal version of the software and then reproduces, copies or installs it onto computer hard disks. The person then sells the product. This often happens at PC resale shops and buyers aren’t always aware that the additional software they are buying is illegal.

####  iv) Counterfeiting

Counterfeiting occurs when software programs are illegally duplicated and sold with the appearance of authenticity. Counterfeit software is usually sold at a discounted price in comparison to the legitimate software.

####  v) Online Piracy

Online piracy, also known as Internet piracy, is when illegal software is sold, shared or acquired by means of the Internet. This is usually done through a peer-to-peer (P2P)  file-sharing system  which is usually found in the form of online auction sites and blogs.

## 1.1.4 Computer Network intrusion
A network intrusion refers to any unauthorized activity on a digital network. Network intrusions often involve stealing valuable network resources and always the security of networks and/or their data. 

In order to proactively detect and respond to network intrusions organizations and their cybersecurity teams need to have a thorough understanding of how network intrusions work and implement network intrusion, detection, and response systems that are designed with attack techniques and cover-up methods in mind.
#### IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a monitor-only program that detects and reports irregularities in your network architecture before hackers may do damage. IDS can be set up on your network or on a client system (host-based IDS).
#### Types of Intrusion
-   Asymmetric Routing
-   Buffer Overflow Attacks
-   Common Gateway Interface Scripts
-   Protocol-Specific Attacks
-   Traffic Flooding
-   Trojans
-   Worms

1.  **Host Intrusion Detection System:**  This system operates on network hosts or standalone devices. It takes a snapshot of the current system files and compares it to prior snapshots. Similarly, if the analytical system files are modified or destroyed, an alert is sent to the administrator for further inquiry.
    
2.  **Network Intrusion Detection System:**  They are strategically located across the network to monitor traffic from all devices connected to the Internet. Primarily, it performs an analysis of passing traffic on the whole subnet and compares that information to a database of known threats. When it detects an assault or detects strange activity, it alerts the administrator.

# 1.2 Category of Cyber Crime

## 1.2.1 How criminals plan attacks
1.  Reconnaissance (information gathering) is the first phase 
2.  Scanning and scrutinizing the gathered information for the validity of the informationas as well as to identify the existing vulnerabilities.
3. gaining and maintaining the system access
4. Launching an attack

## 1.2.2 Active and Passive Attack : 
In **Active attack**, attackers put effort to change or modify the content of messages or data or system. Active attack is dangerous to integrity as well as to availability.System is always changed or badly affected.
	Most importantly Victim gets informed about the attack.
	example : Dos attack,Sql injection,Cross site scripting,Malware,virus etc.

In **Passive attack** attackers try to get unauthorized access to the system to observe the content or data or the can copy the data to.But no direct Harm to the system.
		Victim does not get informed about the attack.
		example : Man in the middle, Social Engineering , shoulder surfing etc.

## 1.2.3 Cyberstalking

Cyberstalking is a technologically-based "attack" on one person who has been targeted specifically for that attack for reasons of anger, revenge or control. Cyberstalking can take many forms, including: harassment, embarrassment and humiliation of the victim.

# 2. Cybercrime Mobile & Wireless devices

## 2.1 Security challenges posted by mobile devices

**i). Application based threat:**  
The most of application are downloadable and purposed the most common risk for mobile users; most devices don’t do much on their own, and it is the applications that make them so awesome and we all download apps. If it comes to apps the risks run from bugs and basic security risks on the low end of the scale all the way through malicious apps with no other purpose to commit cyber crime.

-   Malware
-   Spyware
-   Privacy
-   Zero Day Vulnerabilities

**ii). Web based threat:**  
According to the nature of mobile use, the fact that we have our devices with us everywhere we go and are connecting to the Internet while doing so, they face the number of unique web-based threats as well as the run-of-the-mill threats of general Internet use.

-   Phishing Scams
-   Social Engineering
-   Drive By Downloads
-   Operating System Flaws

**iii). Network-based threat:**  
Any mobile devices which typically support a minimum of three network capabilities making them three-times vulnerable to network-based attack. And a network often found on a mobile include cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth.-   
-   Network exploits
-   WiFi sniffing
-   Cross-Platform Attacks
-   BOYD

**iv). Physical Threats:**  
It is happened any time, unlikely a desktop sitting at your workstation, or even a laptop in your bag, a mobile device is subject to a number of everyday physical threats.

-   **Loss/Theft:**  
    Loss or theft is the most unwanted physical threat to the security of your mobile device. Any devices itself has value and can be sold on the secondary market after all your information is stolen and sold.

## 2.2 Cryptographic Security for Mobile Devices

## 2.3 Various types of virus in laptop

-   **File Virus:**  
    This type of virus infects the system by appending itself to the end of a file. It changes the start of a program so that the control jumps to its code. After the execution of its code, the control returns back to the main program. Its execution is not even noticed. It is also called a  **Parasitic virus** because it leaves no file intact but also leaves the host functional.  
    
-   **Boot sector Virus:**  
    It infects the boot sector of the system, executing every time system is booted and before the operating system is loaded. It infects other bootable media like floppy disks. These are also known as  **memory viruses** as they do not infect the file systems.


-   **Macro Virus:**  
    Unlike most viruses which are written in a low-level language(like C or assembly language), these are written in a high-level language like Visual Basic. These viruses are triggered when a program capable of executing a macro is run. For example, the macro viruses can be contained in spreadsheet files.  
    
-   **Source code Virus:**  
    It looks for source code and modifies it to include virus and to help spread it.  
    
-   **Polymorphic Virus:**  
    A  **virus signature**  is a pattern that can identify a virus(a series of bytes that make up virus code). So in order to avoid detection by antivirus a polymorphic virus changes each time it is installed. The functionality of the virus remains the same but its signature is changed.  
    
-   **Encrypted Virus:**  
    In order to avoid detection by antivirus, this type of virus exists in encrypted form. It carries a decryption algorithm along with it. So the virus first decrypts and then executes.  
    
-   **Stealth Virus:**  
    It is a very tricky virus as it changes the code that can be used to detect it. Hence, the detection of viruses becomes very difficult. For example, it can change the read system call such that whenever the user asks to read a code modified by a virus, the original form of code is shown rather than infected code.  
    
-   **Tunneling Virus:**  
    This virus attempts to bypass detection by antivirus scanner by installing itself in the interrupt handler chain. Interception programs, which remain in the background of an operating system and catch viruses, become disabled during the course of a tunneling virus. Similar viruses install themselves in device drivers.  
    
-   **Multipartite Virus:**  
    This type of virus is able to infect multiple parts of a system including the boot sector, memory, and files. This makes it difficult to detect and contain.  
    
-   **Armored Virus:**  
    An armored virus is coded to make it difficult for antivirus to unravel and understand. It uses a variety of techniques to do so like fooling antivirus to believe that it lies somewhere else than its real location or using compression to complicate its code.  
    
-   **Browser Hijacker:**  
    As the name suggests this virus is coded to target the user’s browser and can alter the browser settings. It is also called the browser redirect virus because it redirects your browser to other malicious sites that can harm your computer system.
-   **Memory Resident Virus:**

	Resident viruses installation store for your RAM and meddle together along with your device operations. They behave in a very secret and dishonest way that they can even connect themselves for the anti-virus software program files.

-   **Direct Action Virus:**

	The main perspective of this virus is to replicate and take action when it is executed. When a particular condition is met the virus will get into action and infect files in the directory that are specified in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file path.

-   **Overwrite virus:**

	This type of virus deletes the information contained in the file that it infects, rendering them partially or totally is useless once they have been infected.

-   **Directory Virus:**

	This virus is also called called File System Virus or Cluster Virus. It infects the directory of the computer by modifying the path that is indicating the location of a file.

-   **Companion Virus:**

	This kind of virus usually use the similar file name and create a different extension of it. For example, if there’s a file “Hello.exe”, the virus will create another file named Hello.com  and will hide in the new file

-   **FAT Virus:**

	The  **File Allocation Table** is the part of the disk used to store all information about the location of files, available space , unusable space etc.

	This virus affects the FAT section and may damage crucial information.
